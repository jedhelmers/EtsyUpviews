# WELCOME TO MY ETSY-O-NATOR

## This project allows a user to 'up' their etsy item views.
I know what you're thinking, "... why would someone want to up their etsy item views?"
Great question. From observation, I get the strangest feeling that etsy's search algorithm determines search relevancy by the number of times an item has been viewed.
From there it probably goes on to add weight to certain tags on certain items all in an attempt to optimize user satisfaction. However...

This screws over all the shops doing good work who get zero traction. That's where I come in.

This project games an already flawed model. It doesn't make sales: it simply brings items to the foreground. What the better-informed consumer does from there is up to them.

### PYTHON
This project uses python and some anonymity functions written by much smart people than myself. I'll get into that later.

### JAVASCRIPT TO KNOW
In order to load a searchable library of items, I've been manually scrapping item links directly from an Etsy shop's page. Javascript is great for this. I'll get into that later.
